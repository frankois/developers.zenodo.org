# REST API

## Introduction

The Zenodo REST API currently supports:

* **Deposit** — upload and publishing of research outputs (identical to
  functionality available in the user interface).
* **Records** — search published records.
* **Files** — download/upload of files.

Check out the [Quickstart](#quickstart-upload) guide for an example on how to
programmatically upload and publish your research outputs.

The following REST APIs are currently in testing before we launch them in
**beta** with full documentation:

* **Communities** - search communities.
* **Funders** — search for funders.
* **Grants** — search for grants.
* **Licenses** — search for licenses.

You can have a sneak peek at the APIs in test from our root endpoint: `https://zenodo.org/api/`
